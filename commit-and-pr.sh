- Add 2MB per session byte cap with automatic termination
- Implement 10-minute inactivity timeout with reset on input
- Add session logging with unique correlation IDs
- Enforce non-root process execution for security
- Add uuid dependency for session ID generation

Security improvements:
- Prevents remote access by binding to localhost only
- Limits data transfer to prevent resource exhaustion
- Automatic session cleanup prevents resource leaks
- Audit trail for all terminal sessions
- Process security by preventing root execution"
